 client_flags:            CLIENT_xxx options. The list of possible flag
                          values is in the description of the Handshake
                          Initialisation Packet, for server_capabilities.
                          For some of the bits, the server passed "what
                          it's capable of". The client leaves some of the
                          bits on, adds others, and passes back to the server.
                          One important flag is: whether compression is desired.

 max_packet_size:         the maximum number of bytes in a packet for the client

 charset_number:          in the same domain as the server_language field that
                          the server passes in the Handshake Initialization packet.

 user:                    identification

 scramble_buff:           the password, after encrypting using the scramble_buff
                          contents passed by the server (see "Password functions"
                          section elsewhere in this document)
                          if length is zero, no password was given

 databasename:            name of schema to use initially
